# Project_1_DataStructures
This was a project to make a stack and perform three test. The first test (Test A) was to load 3 values into the stack and then pop the stack until there is an underflow. The second test (Test B) was to pop an empty stack. The third test (Test C) was to load four values into the stack and to push another value to create an overflow.
